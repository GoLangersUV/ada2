// Package main implements the ModEx program, which addresses the problem of Opinion
// extremism in a simulated social network. In this network, each agent holds an
// Opinion on a specific topic, quantified on a scale from -100 to 100. Values closer
// to 0 represent more moderate opinions, while extreme values (-100 or 100) represent
// higher levels of extremism. Additionally, each agent has a Receptivity level ranging
// from 0 to 1, which determines how easily their Opinion can be moderated.
//
// The goal of the ModEx program is to reduce extremism in the network by moderating
// agents' opinions. This is achieved by investing an effort, calculated based on each
// agent's Receptivity and extremism level. Given a maximum amount of availableresources,
// the program must determine which agents to target to achieve the greatest possible
// reduction in extremism across the network.
